# Crime-Hotspot-Detection

## 📝 Description
This project uses real-world crime data from Los Angeles (2020–2024) to analyze patterns and predict potential hotspots using machine learning models. The aim is to assist law enforcement in better resource allocation and decision-making through data-driven insights.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: `LA_Crime_Data_from_2020_to_2024.csv` (loaded locally in the notebook)
- **Features**: Includes fields like `Victim Sex`, `Victim Descent`, `Weapon Used`, `Premis Description`, `Crime Codes`, `Date`, and `Status`.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, Model Selection, Evaluation)
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint for presentation

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Null values handled, irrelevant features dropped.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual insights using heatmaps, bar charts, and Plotly maps.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Label encoding and scaling.
4. **Model Training**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy scores and classification reports used for performance comparison.
6. **Visualization**: Interactive and static plots to identify hotspots and patterns.

## 📊 Results
- Models trained to classify/predict crime-related outcomes.
- Identification of high-crime areas and most common crime types.
- Evaluation metrics provided for model performance.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Crime Hotspot (1).ipynb` – Main notebook for data analysis and modeling.
- `CRIME HOTSPOT DETECTION.pptx` – Summary presentation of the findings.
